This folder contains support for Blinkiverse's 32u4 based
Arduino-compatible boards:
AnalogLEDFader
UsbDmx
Blinkyboard
Blinkyboard8

To add support for these boards to your Arduino IDE, simply
copy this folder into your hardware directory in one of two
places:
- the actual Arduino directory
- inside your Sketchbook directory

Note that this will only work under Arduino IDE versions 1.0.1
or later!!!

Information on compiling and programming the bootloader can be
found in the bootloader directory.


This is based on SparkFun's board support system:
https://github.com/blinkiverse/Blinkiverse32u4_boards

Which is in turn based on Arduino and LUFA. Thanks to everyone for being awesome!
